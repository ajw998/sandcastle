Various answers and implementations to interesting (but simple) programming tasks/challenges
I discovered online.

## Constraints

A lot of these programming exercises/challenges could be trivialised by simply
importing a library. However, this would not provide any learning experience.
Thus, these solutions will only use the available standard libraries/modules
available to the language at hand, unless otherwise stated.
